# AI-Powered Resume Scanning & Analysis API

This project provides a FastAPI-based backend for analyzing resumes against job descriptions. It offers endpoints to calculate a matching score and suggest missing keywords, using modern NLP techniques.

## Project Structure

```
resume_scanner/
├── main.py            # FastAPI app with API endpoints
├── utils.py           # NLP and scoring utility functions
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
```

## File Explanations

### 1. `main.py`
- **Purpose:** Main entry point for the FastAPI application.
- **Key Components:**
  - Imports FastAPI, Pydantic, and utility functions.
  - Defines a Pydantic model `ResumeJobInput` for structured request data.
  - Implements two POST endpoints:
    - `/matching-score`: Returns a similarity score (0-100%) between a resume and a job description.
    - `/keyword-suggestions`: Returns keywords from the job description that are missing in the resume.

### 2. `utils.py`
- **Purpose:** Contains reusable NLP and scoring logic.
- **Key Components:**
  - Loads the spaCy English language model.
  - `calculate_matching_score(resume_text, job_description_text)`: Uses CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to compute a matching score.
  - `extract_missing_keywords(resume_text, job_description_text)`: Extracts keywords from the job description not present in the resume using spaCy.

### 3. `requirements.txt`
- **Purpose:** Lists all required Python packages for the project.
- **Key Packages:**
  - `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic` (for API)
  - `spacy`, `scikit-learn` (for NLP)

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r resume_scanner/requirements.txt
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```
2. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   uvicorn resume_scanner.main:app --reload
   ```
3. **Open the API docs:**
   Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) in your browser to test the endpoints interactively.

## Endpoints

### `/matching-score` (POST)
- **Input:**
  ```json
  {
    "resume_text": "...",
    "job_description_text": "..."
  }
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```json
  { "matching_score": 85.0 }
  ```

### `/keyword-suggestions` (POST)
- **Input:**
  ```json
  {
    "resume_text": "...",
    "job_description_text": "..."
  }
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```json
  { "missing_keywords": ["Python", "Team Collaboration", ...] }
  ```

## Notes
- No database is required; all processing is in-memory.
- `__pycache__` folders are auto-generated by Python and can be ignored.
